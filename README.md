This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Goals
* Use Redux for state management
* Figure out hit detection
* Figure out how to make an object travel using an angle and not simple additions or deductions from an X and Y coordinate
* Use React to render
* Render at 60 fps.
* Play sounds

This was a very educational project an I can safely say I'm going to use Redux for every future project as well as Immer.
