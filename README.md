This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This projects uses redux for stage management. Most game changes are done using redux dispatches to manipulate game state. React is reduced (no pun intended) to a 'dump' rendering engine of DOM elements 60 times a second.

So far this game has been an interesting exploration of calculation of angles.
